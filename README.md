# Refactor ATM 
## This project allows you to withdraw and deposit money.

## Description
### Choose either withdraw or deposit. Use the arrows to in the box to choose a number. If you choose deposit, then submit your number, the number next to 'Account Balance will change. If you choose withdraw, then select another number, one that cannot exceed the amount in the account balance, and press submit, the number next to 'Account Balance' will subtract the number submitted and present a new number. There is a background of Homer Simpson with money all around. I changed the font sizes and color and formatted them all differently.
